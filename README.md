# Wordress Simple Bootstrap

Simple Bootstrap is a basic Wordpress theme using Boostrap 3, mostly aimed as a starting point for developers to build their own themes using Bootstrap.

It is build to very clean, responsive and easy to modify. It supports customizable background, image header and both left and right sidebars (the sidebars only appear if you put widgets in them).

## Extension guide

Although it's not absolutely necessary it's recommended to edit the LESS files instead of directly editing the `style.css` . It will then be necessary to re-compile these files with the `Gruntfile.js`. Here are the lines you will have to type to do so (assuming you already have installed nodejs):

```
npm install
npm run build
```
