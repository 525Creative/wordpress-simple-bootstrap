WP BOOTSTRAP
===================

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) in WordPress theme form. 

Used Eddie Machado's Bones for a starting point (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) but it doesn't look too much like it any longer. 


Basic Wordpress theme using Boostrap. Built to be very clean.

Originally based on this theme: http://www.320press.com/wp-bootstrap
